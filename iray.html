<p>Java ArrayList is a part of the Java collection framework and it is a class of java.util package. 
    It provides us with dynamic arrays in Java. Though, it may be slower than standard arrays but can be helpful 
    in programs where lots of manipulation in the array is needed. This class is found in java.util package. 
    The main advantages of Java ArrayList are, if we declare an array then itâ€™s needed to mention the size but in
     ArrayList,it is not needed to mention the size of ArrayList if you want to mention the size then you can do it.
